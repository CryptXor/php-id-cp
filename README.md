# php-id-cp
A coss-platform tool to help identify the protection of a PHP file
Please do take note that this is a very simple, yet messy way of going about the detection process. 
I might change everything if there is actual interest in the project, to be much more efficient and bolster many additional features; However, for now, it is quick and dirty!

Draws inspiration from Manhunter's ID tool and PEiD!

# Note
I hate Pascal. I use it because it is simple to create a GUI in, however the output binaries are now stupidly large, even after compression and stripping.
I will be creating a C++ version of this utility in the coming weeks, mostly out of sheer boredom :smile:
